DESCRIPTION :

The objective of this project is to develop a recommendation engine that can suggest products or content based on user preferences. The system should use machine learning techniques, specifically collaborative filtering, to analyze past user interactions and predict future choices.

Your recommendation system should be able to:
 
 Process user data (ratings, interactions, preferences).

 Analyze patterns and similarities among users or items.

 Generate personalized recommendations for users.

 Use Apache Mahout’s collaborative filtering algorithms to improve accuracy.

By the end of this project, you will have a working recommendation system that can be applied to various domains like e-commerce product suggestions, movie recommendations, or music playlist generation.
